# Module-1-Homework---Fintech-Case-Study
**Overview & Origin**

The company I have chosen in the fintech space is TreasurySpring

TreasurySpring was founded in 2016 by Kevin Cook (CEO), Matthew Longhurst (COO) and James Skillen (CTO) who have worked together since 2006 [1]

The idea of the company came to the founders after the 2008 financial crisis when there was a liquidity crisis facing the short term bond market. Founders saw that what was once a secure, low risk investment such as the short term fixed income market they wanted to bring back that level of security in the investing field to be able to diversify portfolios. Post major FI failures in 2008 the company realized that banks were subject to inherent risk of their own and there was no sense of truly secure investments after seeing short term fixed income from major banks like lehman brothers take such a large blow [2]

The total funding for the company was $14.5 Million as per crunch base [3]

The company was originally funded in amounts of roughly 1.5 million pounds in the first 2-3 years of inception with 7-9 individuals contributing the funds, and went on series A funding in 2021 when it was given 7 million pounds by Anthemis group and MMC ventures. Anthemis group is a capital market company from the UK and MMC is also venture capital firm in the UK

**Business Activities**

The major financial problem that this company is trying to solve is the liquidity risk associated with traditional short term fixed income financial instruments that no one realized were present until the 2008 financial crisis. In 2008 many of the bond rating agencies and institutions who would rate fixed income products were full of corruption and unsavory business practices which misled many people.

The companies target markets are large cash investors who want to have an option of placing their cash and short term funds into the fixed income market without the same liquidity risks that many companies were faced with in the 2008 financial crisis. There are many institutions that have treasury needs for their companies but don’t have the infrastructure and depend on the treasury infrastructure of large FI’s that were once thought to be so large that they could not fail but as 2008 demonstrated they can.

 The company wants to help provide short term fixed income solutions through products called FTF’s(Fixed-Term Funds). The FTF product has three class categories: government, banks and corporations. The FTF’s are meant to offer only extremely highly quality rated bonds and fixed income options through their platform and machine learning system which can detect and help to eliminate the false ratings and false scoring systems that were the result of a corrupt system in the pre 2008 era. The company aims at creating a system for large institutional cash holding investors to have access to high quality information in order to properly diversify their risk. The FTF’s are all 100% maturity matched so that in the event an institution needs to have access to their short term cash deposits they are able to and don’t run the risk of not being able to access these funds when they need them. 


One of the major applications of technology they use is machine learning and AI to be able to make predictions on the future trends and create financial instruments based on their technical analysis of the market to be able to adjust their fixed income portfolio holdings in order to maximize returns for their clients while also preserving capital. This technology helps to actively manage investment products and align their investment objectives with appropriate metrics that were once the responsibility of fund managers and are now being automated with AI and machine learning.

**Landscape**

The financial domain that this company is in Treasury management of large institutional investors with large amounts of cash 

The biggest innovations and domains in the Treasury management domain in the last decade have been in developing treasury management software to help organizations build and map their treasury planning needs and to have a more clear picture of the options they have for managing their treasury department operations and a more accurate reading of analytics in order to make decisions on where how they manage their large cash balances. 

Other major companies in this field and direct competitors to treasuryspring are wisdomtree, ishares, circa5000. Companies like wisdomtree, Vangaurd and ishares (owned by blackrock) are direct competitors in this space who also use machine learning and AI to be able to bring down the cost of their exchange traded funds and give people access to fund investment products at a lower cost than traditional FI’s such as banks by eliminating the need for fund managers and people who bring the MER’s of funds higher and higher. The same logic and technology is used to solve a similar problem only on the fixed income side of investments. 

**Results**

“Following a break-out 12 months in which we increased AUM by 10x” - Kevin Cook (CEO) [5] - Quote by CEO Kevin Cook

“It says it’s now issued more than $9 billion of FTFs to a client base which includes FTSE 100 and other listed companies, fund managers, large private companies, charities and family offices.” [5]

These are two quotes from an article dated as of June 2021. The AUM having grown by 10x is a very big accomplishment and large number for an asset management company to have in terms of growth. It makes sense for early stage companies to experience high growth, but following up with $9B of FTF to the client base gives us an idea of the size of the company. The company was founded in 2016 and to have x10 growth up to $9B AUM is very strong. To put into perspective Vangaurd AUM is sitting at roughly $7.2 trillion which is a firm that is rooted into the economy and has deep pockets and a strong client base. If that growth keeps up for Treasury spring as its if we see another x10 jump in 5 years the company should be seeing roughly $90B AUM. But usually growth at this stage for a company is exponential so most likely for a period of time if the company continues to grow it will grow faster and faster the bigger that it gets. [5]

**Recommendations**

The first recommendation that I would make to the company is to integrate a treasury reserve of crypto products as some very big companies at the moment are starting to integrate crypto products into their treasuries and will soon have a need to use digital currency in their cash treasury reserves as we can the digitization of local currencies like Renminbi (RMN) that is in use in China and issued by the central bank of China. Other companies such as KPMG have integrated cryptocurrency and blockchain into their treasuries already [6].

The technology that it already uses for manage its FTF products would have to be different by changing the indicators in the software for what kind of metrics to use in order to rebalance the product in order to maintain its risk profile and provide security for the clients. At the moment crypto is much more volatile than the traditional bond markets but slowly there are crypto’s emerging that are more and more stable like bitcoin and ethereum.
